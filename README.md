Map My Learning is a Flask web application designed to help at-risk and struggling students who are transitioning from high school 
to college develop effective study habits. This tool delivers just-in-time surveys to students at the beginning and end of 
each class meeting.  These surveys ask students to self-assess their understanding of reading assignments, homework, and 
lecture topics. Responses to the survey questions are stored in the system's PostgreSQL database. Students can track the 
progress of their learning throughout the semester by viewing 1) a line chart that shows their learning over time and 2) a doughnut
chart that shows the number of learning objectives students have fully mastered, the number of learning objectives they have
partially mastered, and the number of learning objectives they still need to learn. Teachers can also use these visual 
representations to help students create study plans for high-stakes midterm and final exams.   

#### Technologies Used
Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Jinja2, Bootstrap, Chart.js, jQuery, JSON, Google OAuth
