1.1	Introduction to Statistics	Students understand and  can explain the following terms: descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, population, sample, qualitative data, quantitative data, discrete data, continuous data.  	1
2.2	Graphs	Students understand and can explain the following types of graphs: Bar chart, dot plot, histogram, stem-and-leaf display, and box plots; data distribution behavior: Mound-shaped & symmetric, skewed left, skewed right	1
2.3	Measures of Central Tendency 		1
2.4	Measures of Spread		1
2.5	Chevyshev's & the Empirical Rule		1
2.6	Relative Standing		1
3.2	Probability		1
3.3	Conditional Probability		1
4.2	Binomial Distribution		1
4.3	Binomial Parameters	Students understand and can solve for the mean and standard deviation for a binomial distribution	1
5.2	The Normal Distribution: Probabilities	Students can explain the shape of the normal distribution and the probabilities that correspond to each section of the distribution. They can also use what they know about the normal distribution to answer word problems about the probability of certain outcomes.	1
5.3	The Normal Distribution: Variable values	Students can use what they know about the normal distribution to answer word problems by solving for the values of different variables in the probability density function.	1
6.2	The Central Limit Theorem	Students understand that the distribution of a mean tends to be Normal (even when the distribution from which the mean is computed - the parent population - is decidedly non-Normal), as the sample size increases	1
